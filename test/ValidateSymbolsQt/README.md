# ValidateSymbolsQt

This is a validation application that may be used to verify the Military Features Data repository. 

## Features

This is a command line application that may be used to 

* Create exported 2525 or APP6 symbol image files using the ArcGIS Runtime for Qt
* Export all symbol images from the ArcGIS Runtime symbol dictionary file
* Automatically compare those created images to existing validated images
* Create a list and folder of images that fail to match

## Requirements

* ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt 10.2 (or later) 
* The [Qt Software Developer Kit](http://qt.digia.com/) with Qt Creator
    * Hardware and software (including Qt SDK version) requirements are the same as those for ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt.  See the [Runtime SDK documentation for more information](https://developers.arcgis.com/en/qt/).
* [Optional] Apache Ant - used to download and extract dependent data files (you may also do this manually if you do not wish to install ant)

## Instructions

### Building

* Check your development environment is properly configured for the ArcGIS Runtime SDK for Qt; some items of note:
    * Ensure the configuration file, ex. `esri_runtime_qt_10_2.prf` has been installed
        * Copied from` {ARCGISRUNTIMESDKQT}\sdk\ideintegration\esri_runtime_qt_10_2.prf to {QTDIR}\mkspecs\features\esri_runtime_qt_10_2.prf` 
    * (Linux only) Initialize runtime. From a Command Prompt> `> . {RuntimeSDKHome}/init_sdk_qt64.sh`
* Open and build the project `ValidateSymbolsQt`  in Qt Creator
    * Note: if you are not using the latest version of the Runtime SDK, you may need to edit the .pro file for each project
    * Change the line `CONFIG += esri_runtime_qt_10_2_2` to match the version of your Runtime SDK.

### Running

* Download the data dependencies
    * These are the validated 2525C and APP6 image files/folders
        * [`VALIDATED_IMAGES_2525C`](http://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/content/items/6e35554cfcde44a88ede4e75428591bf/data) 
* Name and place the folder downloaded above at VALIDATED_IMAGES in the same folder/level as the executable ValidateSymbols.exe
* The application uses the following folders:
    * VALIDATED_IMAGES - this folder must exist and contain the images to be used for comparison
        * 2 Folders: `VALIDATED_IMAGES_2525` -or- `VALIDATED_IMAGES_APP6`
    * GENERATED_IMAGES - images generated by the current Runtime/Dictionary 
    * MISMATCHED_IMAGES - the set of images that failed to be matched
* Run the application with the desired parameters, e.g. 
    *  ValidateSymbols.exe VALIDATE 2525 ALL 
        *  This will export all 2525 images and validate them against the images in the folder `VALIDATED_IMAGES_2525`
*  The available command-line parameters include
    * Parameter 1 : Command
        * GENERATE - only generates the images to the `GENERATED_IMAGES_FOLDER` (Default)
        * VALIDATE - does GENERATE & then validates these against images in `VALIDATED_IMAGES_FOLDER`
        * VALIDATE_ONLY - validation only (doesn't do GENERATE step)
    * Parameter 2 : Standard
        * 2525 (Default)
        * APP6
    * Parameter 3 : Filter
        * ALL - do for all found in the dictionary
        * FILE - do for all from a supplied file (see Parameter 4)
        * SymbolId - do for a single Id supplied (Default)
    * Parameter 4 : FileName (Optional)
        * FileName - a supplied csv file name, SymbolId must be 1st entry in each comma-delimited list, lines with "#" will be skipped
