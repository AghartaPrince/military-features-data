## Description

This folder contains the files used to create the legacy Pairwise test datasets. For both 2525C and 2525Bc2 there are three folders. You can find step by step instructions for creating Pairwise test data [here](https://github.com/Esri/military-features-data/tree/v.next/data/mil2525d/utilities/pairwise-testing)

# Input
These folders contain the source data for the PICT process, in the form of text files divided by appendix and platform type. In addition, these folders contain intermediate output Excel files. Once an OID field is added, these can be saved as the PICT output CSVs.

# Output
These folders contain the csv files that can be the input for creating pairwise test data using [this geoprocessing model.](https://github.com/Esri/military-features-data/tree/v.next/data/mil2525c_b2/test_data/Complete_test_scripts)

# ExtendedFunctionCode 
These folders contain intermediate data, derived from the [truth data](https://github.com/Esri/military-features-data/tree/v.next/data/mil2525c_b2/test_data/truth_data) for 2525C and Bc2 for use in the Pairwise Input text files.
